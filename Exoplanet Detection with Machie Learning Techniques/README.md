# ML_NASA_EXOPLANETS
The interpretation and characterization of exoplanets from astronomical observations pose sig-
nificant challenges due to the presence of false positives which arise from instrumental noise,
stellar activity, and other kinds of astronomical phenomena. In this study, we explore the uti-
lization of various machine learning classification methods to distinguish whether an observation
can be considered a candidate exoplanet or should be labeled as a false positive. Furthermore,
our aim is to propose a model that can effectively help researchers reduce or validate future
observations. For this matter, we are utilizing labeled data from the NASA Exoplanets dataset,
extracted from the Kepler Space Telescope. This work compares 4 Machine Learning Classifi-
cation techniques, namely Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, MultiLayer Perceptron
and XGBoost. The findings suggest that while the four techniques show promising results,
the Random Forest approach is able to better extrapolate the patterns on the data both with
and without precomputed features. This study is an effort to contribute to the ever growing
field of exoplanet detection, and future work could explore the possibilities of implementing
deep-learning methods to enhance the abilities of the existing approaches.
